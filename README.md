# Next-Word-predictor-using-lstm
Developed a deep learning model to predict the next word in a text sequence using LSTM networks. • Implemented text preprocessing, tokenization, embeddings, and trained the model with Keras/TensorFlow. • Evaluated performance with categorical cross-entropy loss and demonstrated applications in autocomplete systems.
